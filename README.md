# puzzle15

This is the first game I made in C++. It is a console application that emulates the popular Puzzle 15 game, in which users attempt to shift 15 numbered tiles into their correct slots. The code features many skills and concepts regarding C++ that I had learned up to that point, including the use of classes, differentiation of code into various .h and .cpp files, and operator overloading. The game mechanics are very simple: the user uses the A, W, S, and D keys to shift tiles left, up, right, or down respectively. When all of the tiles are in their correct positions, the console application closes. Some possible edits for this application would be to add a graphic interface and to offer the user the chance to play again when the game finishes (rather than closing suddenly).
